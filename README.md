# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Client Louise wants to fund her play "Fever" with a fundraiser and needs our assistance in sorting through the data available on a variety of fundraising campaigns.

### Purpose
We need to sort and filter fundraising campaign data and determine if there are patterns on which we might base recommendations for success to Louise.

## Analysis and Challenges
The data was sorted and filtered to focus specifically on fundraising campaigns in the same category and subcategory as Louise's. Charts were generated to display outcomes based on launch dates and goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only difficulties encountered were caused by the limited skills of the author. There were many inconsistencies that I blame on my own inexperience.

## Results

### Conclusions About Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data clearly shows May and June to be the best months to initiate fundraising campaigns.  July and August follow closely in third and fourth place.  This leads me to conclude that summer is the best season to launch a theater fundraiser.
Winter is the least successful season for such fundraising.  However, if there are reasons to attempt a fundraiser in winter, it would be best to launch in February.  February is the only winter month with success similar to summer. If possible, avoid December entirely since it has the least success of any month.

### Conclusions About Outcomes Based on Goals
Fundraising campaigns with modest goals tend to be more successful.  In the $10000-14999 goal range, only 54% of fundraisers were successful.  If Louise can trim her budget, her chances of success increase.  If Louise chooses to keep $10000 as her goal, she might want to be prepared with alternative sources of fundraising or additional campaigns, in case she does not meet her goal.  

### Limitations
There are multiple variables that could have a significant impact on success for which we have no data.

#### Audience
While the percentage of successful campaigns progressively decreased as goals increased, this trend ceased in the $35000-44999 range. It would be helpful to know household incomes within the geographic area targeted by a fundraiser.  It is possible that this small number of fundraisers with large goals met success because they targeted a wealthier audience.

#### Advertising
There is no data available on how much and what type of advertising was done for these fundraisers. There were only 5 projects in the $25000-29999 goal range and only 1 was successful.  With the data we currently have, it looks as if that goal was too large, but it might be that those 4 unsuccessful campaigns simply did not promote themselves enough.

### Further Analysis Recommended

#### Donors
It would be helpful to consider the relationships between the average donation, the number of backers, and the relative success of a campaign. Are a small number of donors giving large sums of money? Are more successful campaigns made so by larger numbers of smaller donations?

#### Length of Campaign
It would beneficial to determine if there is any correlation between the length of a campaign and its success. Do campaigns that last longer bring in more money?  If not, it would not benefit Louise to use her resources longer than necessary.
